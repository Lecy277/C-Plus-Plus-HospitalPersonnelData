# HospitalPersonnelData

This program randomly adds 1,000 lines of hospital records to a file. It includes the generateHospitalPersonnelData.cpp which does the randomization by pulling the objects for the data from the HospitalPersonnelData.h and the generateHospitalPersonnelData.h creates the object name for the Struct and the Outfile.
